        <section class=""><div data-svelte-h="svelte-5zd5ed"><nav class=""><a class="" href="/hoyoverse-character-guides-kit/about">About</a> <a class="" href="/hoyoverse-character-guides-kit/">Home</a> <a class="" href="/hoyoverse-character-guides-kit/characters/hsr">Honkai: Star Rail</a></nav></div> <h1 class="name svelte-1m7xjr">blade</h1>  <div><h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-1d66zkk">This is the Blade Guide Script</h1> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1vo04f4">Intro</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kcid03">Blade is a character that, when he came out, I actually never intended on pulling for but after watching gameplay and seeing his potential, I knew that this was a character that I needed. Unlike some other characters, Blade is a kind of set and forget type where as long as whatever you’re doing is weak to wind, or you’re bringing Silver Wolf, you can bring him and he’s going to do really well. Since he’s come out, I’ve been using him in daily grind content, weekly grind content, Simulated Universe, events, everything, and there hasn’t been a single time where I’ve ever had the thought, “I shouldn’t have used this team.” So, with that really high praise, let’s look at what he actually does.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-gbhmy0">What he does</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1s8hk8d">Blade is a very straightforward damage carry whose main mechanic is consuming his own HP to deal increased damage and trigger follow-up attacks. Even though his kit relies on consuming his HP like Arlan, he doesn’t benefit from staying at low health and needs to be healed back up to full. Blade has a couple ways of doing this on his own but this cycle of consuming and healing is easier to manage with a strong healer. Before going into this, I wanna preface that any numbers are all at rank 10.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1g4nk4s">Talent</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1luxmjr">Starting with his talent, “Shuhu’s Gift”, whenever Blade loses health or consumes his own health, he gains a stack of “Charge” that stacks up to 5 times, which is indicated by the number on his portrait. When Blade reaches 5 stacks, he does a follow-up attack for a high amount of damage. At the same time, he restores 25% of his HP. After using his follow-up attack, all stacks are consumed and he starts over.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lj5527">I’ll go over teams in detail later but something to keep in mind is that because gaining stacks relies on losing health instead of just being attacked, this makes any source of shields a huge detriment to his damage, unlike someone like Clara who only needs to be the target of an attack.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xoccep">But that also means that he doesn’t need to be attacked directly at all. If an enemy counters and deals damage, that counts. If Blade has a DoT, the damage from that counts. If you’re doing Simulated Universe, any blessing that consumes health also works.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ptx3su">His Talent is also his highest source of damage in AoE situations since it hits everything on the field for full damage, making him really strong in of the daily and weekly grind content.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-tumwt5">Skill</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fuxdi4">Blade’s skill, “Hellscape,” consumes 30% of his HP to increase his damage by 40% and turns his basic attack into, “Forest of Swords” for 3 turns. Using his skill also doesn’t end his current turn and still consumes a skill point even though it also consumes HP. If Blade is under 30% health when you use the skill, then it just sets his health to 1. Using this also doesn’t give him any energy for his Ultimate.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-beasu4">Basic Attack</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-11dcnnx">Blade’s enhanced Basic Attack, “Forest of Swords,” does high damage to one target and a small amount of damage to the two adjacent targets. Using this attack also consumes 10% of his health and because it’s an <em>Enhanced</em> Basic Attack, it also doesn’t generate any skill points. Just like his skill, if he’s under 10% health, then it sets his HP to 1.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1fswy2p">Ultimate</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13b56f6">His Ultimate, “Death Sentence,” sets his HP to 50% does a high amount of damage to 1 target and a small amount of damage to adjacent targets.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1avge9b">There’s some weird things about this skill though that you need to understand to get the most out of it.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rbzca2">For starters, his Ultimate scales the same way that the rest of his skills do where it’s 100% of his max HP and 40% of his ATK, but there’s a third modifier which is 100% of the total HP that he’s lost during the battle prior to using his Ultimate. This number is capped at 90% of his max HP. So using my Blade as an example, with 7424 HP, the max HP he needs to lose before using his Ultimate is 6681, making it look like this:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1q2lpxj">684(ATK) + 7424(Max HP) + 6681(HP Lost) = 14,789(Before damage calculation) Primary Target
273(ATK) + 2988(Max HP) + 2689(HP Lost) = 5950(Before damage calculation) Adjacent Targets</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1un7f9">Reaching the max amount of health lost is where you’re going to see the most variance in damage if you aren’t running him with a really strong healer like Luocha and why he doesn’t want to stay at low health. Because his Ultimate sets his health to 50%, his Ultimate is the biggest way to consume the HP needed to build up the tally, but he needs to be at max HP before getting the full benefit. Realistically, there’s not going to be <em>too</em> much variance in it with how often he gets attacked and attacks with his higher taunt value from being a Destruction character. With most healers in the game, it’s also just not worth the points needed to get him topped up before using his Ultimate and your party’s damage output is going to suffer if you try. This happens on full auto too, where the healing AI won’t try to top him up and he’ll sit just above or below 50%, making it hard for his Ultimate to consume much HP.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yhosj4">With all that said, though, I wouldn’t be too concerned about maximizing the damage potential of it. Most of Blade’s damage comes from his Enhanced Basic Attacks and talent, both in single target and AoE situations, so I wouldn’t delay using his Ultimate just to try and lose more HP to reach the max damage taken. Instead, think of it more as a supplement to his already high damage from the other aspects of his kit.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-uxv952">Or alternatively, you can use it as a heal. Because it sets the HP to 50%, this goes both ways; If he’s above 50% then using this consumes HP until he’s 50% but if he’s <em>under</em> 50%, then he heals up to 50%. Because healers other than Luocha can struggle to get his massive HP pool filled up, this can be an actual life saver if you want to use it that way, and since you won’t need to use skill points on healing, can often mean more overall damage.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1fa36iv">Skill leveling Priority</h2> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-cpp2cc">Traces</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1g1xctf">Next, let’s quickly take a loot at his traces.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-zucthe">His first major trace gives him 20% incoming healing if his health is equal to or under 50%. His second major trace heals him for 5% of his max HP + 100 whenever he hits a Weakness Broken enemy after using his Enhanced Basic Attack. And his third major trace increases his follow-up attack damage by 20%.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13jatz2">The first and second are really unimportant and you’re never really going to notice them when you play him. Pick up his third major trace as soon as you can and then get the other two in any order you want since you’re mostly just unlocking them for the crit and HP minor traces behind them.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-19acn3k">Relics and Planar Ornaments</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-7pfkqw">Now that we have an idea of how he works, let’s go over what sets you want to be farming.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-d46eyy">Because he scales off health, “Longevous Disciple,” is his best in slot, giving him 12% health and 8% crit that stacks twice whenever he loses health, including from consuming his own health. Because just about every attack consumes health, it’s safe to assume this is just a free 16% crit after the first turn for the rest of the fight.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-vjszkp">His second option is 2 piece Longevous with 2 piece “Eagle of Twilight Lane,” for the extra wind damage, followed by 2 piece Longevous and 2 piece, “Messenger Traversing Hackerspace,” from the same Cavern.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ech9cz">Personally, even if mixing with Twilight does more, I wouldn’t farm it just for Blade, and instead use the 2p Messenger setup until you get a good 4p. Blade is more or less the only character that can use Longevous, but Messenger is the new best set for supports so you’re going to be spending a lot of time in there anyway.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14worf0">For your Planar ornaments, you have two options. You can either use Inert Salsotto or Rutilant Arena. Both of these are really strong but which ends up being better depends on if you can hit the 70% crit rate required for Rutilant and how many targets you’re fighting.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z4ee8g">In Single Target scenarios, Rutilant Arena comes out on top, even with the skill portion of the bonus not mattering since his skill doesn’t do any damage. His Enhanced Basic Attack accounts for about half of his damage or more depending on how often he’s getting hit, so the 20% increased damage matters a lot.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-h9oczj">Whereas in AoE scenarios, Salsotto ends up being more valuable since you’re both more likely to be hit and there’s just more targets to hit. Salsotto also gains a lot of value depending on how many Eidolons you have, which I’ll go over later.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fq1xd6">Because of the high crit rate required, I would recommend getting a good Salsotto set. 70% crit crate while also having high crit damage is really difficult to do without his signature light cone and a lot of luck on substats. Getting 50% is a lot more reasonable if you’re trying to get a good balance of crit to crit damage. I would only recommend getting Rutilant Arena if you’re both really lucky with Crit and want to maximize his single target damage.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-xi5978">Stat Priority</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-t33p3v">Now that we know what we’re farming, let’s take a look at the substats that we want to look out for.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kdipxu">For your main pieces you’re going to want Crit or Crit Damage on your chest, depending on which one you need the most, Speed or HP % on your boots, Wind Damage on your Planar Sphere, and HP % on your Link Rope.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1x7xjy3">For substats, the order of priority is going to look like this:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1i6fjbe"><li>Crit / Crit Damage</li> <li>SPD</li> <li>HP</li></ol> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-16l1c16">Light Cones</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-jucewy">For Light Cones, his signature Light Cone, “The Unreachable Side,” is his best in slot. At SI1, it gives 18% Crit Rate and when attacked or Blade consumes his HP, he gains 24% damage that’s removed after using an attack.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1w97svd">If you didn’t pull for his Signature, then, “A Secret Vow,” is his second best option. It provides an unconditional 20% damage increase and if Blade’s health percentage is low than the enemy’s, he gains another 20% damage.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14ungu6">If you don’t have that, “Something Irreplaceable,” is his third best light cone, and, “On the Fall of an Aeon,” is his fourth. Both of these are okay, but they have requirements to get the buff that aren’t as easy to get for Blade consistently and they buff attack which for Blade is pretty pointless because the attack scaling on his attacks are so low.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-z03a23">Team Comps</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1phz569">Moving on to team comps, Blade’s options are honestly really limited. Because he needs to lose health all the time, pairing him with any Preservation character is a massive detriment to his damage, at least until we get one that simply reduces damage taken by the party. Shields from Gepard and March, taunting from Fire MC, all of that makes is harder to take damage and greatly reduces how often he can use his talent and how much damage his Ultimate deals. Even just the higher taunt value of Preservation is bad for his damage.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1l5q10y">He also doesn’t scale very well off attack so supports that buff attack like Tingyun and Asta can’t help his damage anywhere near as much as they can a regular damage carry. Which leaves our 4 star team looking like this:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-3h739d"><li>Blade</li> <li>Natasha (until Lynx)</li> <li>Pela</li> <li>Flex
The 4th slot is really hard to fill for a 4 star team with the options we currently have. Tingyun’s ATK buff doesn’t contribute much to his damage and while the damage buff from her Ultimate is good, the extra Ultimate Energy doesn’t benefit Blade if he hasn’t lost enough HP yet to build up his tally.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-w0n449">Asta’s ATK buff also doesn’t do much but she does give speed which can help with the rest of the party. Since we’ll be using Pela who doesn’t use that many skill points, maintaining her buff isn’t going to be a problem.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1m6bu10">Or, you could put in a second damage character. Because Blade’s single target damage isn’t as high as his AoE, you could slot a strong single target character that matches the elements that you’re fighting.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1a8q54e">Depending on when you’re watching this, Lynx might already be out. In which case, you can ignore Natasha completely and use her. Because Lynx’s skill both increases max HP and makes Destruction Path characters have a higher taunt value, she automatically becomes the number one healer for Blade. She serves the same purpose that March does for Clara but without the shields and an increase in damage making it easier to both lose HP and gain stacks of Charge. Luocha is the only healer right now that can beat Lynx for Blade teams.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ys5ypf">For a premium team though, you’ll want:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1e5glek"><li>Blade</li> <li>Luocha</li> <li>Bronya</li> <li>Silver Wolf</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fodgj1">Bronya is super important to Blade’s damage. The turn advancement helps with how quickly he can lose health and how quickly he can build up stacks, and she buffs damage and crit damage instead of attack. If you’re going from the 4 star team to the premium team, she’s the first one that you want to use in the flex slot.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-dyzes7">Eidolons</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nbfq5w">Finally, I want to look at his Eidolons. Like most characters, he’s perfectly good at E0 and I would never recommend spending money on him unless that’s something that you can comfortably afford to do and you intend to use him for a long time.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-52lt4a">Blade’s E1 adds an additional modifier to his Ultimate dealing an extra 156% of Blade’s HP lost during the battle. This is also capped at 90% of his HP.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-y8avkq">E2 gives 15% crit rate while his skill, “Hellscape,” is active.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-8ttbcl">E3 and E5 as usual give +2 to his skill, Ultimate, and Talent, and +1 to his basic attack</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1pcrb7r">E4 gives a 2 times stacking HP buff whenever his health is equal to or lower than 50%.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ox5tpa">And lastly his E6 reduces his max Charge to 4 and his follow-up attack does an additional 50% of his HP as damage.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1x8gbuz">All his Eidolons are really strong, even E4 despite is just giving a stacking HP buff. Using my own Blade as an example, with both stacks he’d go from 7424 HP to 10393 HP. Considering all his skills are based off his HP, that’s a pretty substantial buff to both his survivability and damage. It also raises the max amount of damage that he can take to maximize his Ultimate’s damage, which got even stronger with E1.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yugg6k">Earlier I mentioned that Inert Salsotto gains value depending on which Eidolons you have. Even though it’s just one extra Charge stack required to use his Talent, E6 increases the frequency of his follow-up attack enough that Inert Salsotto becomes his best in slot.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14ck1wl">If you’re going to be pulling for copies, I would stop at E2. E1 makes his Ultimate a far more significant part of his damage and the extra 15% crit during Hellscape makes gearing easier, getting the 70% crit rate required for Rutilant easier, and in general is a good damage increase. As strong as the extra HP and skill levels are, it’s a <em>lot</em> of money to get to E6 and I don’t think the gain is worth the investment for the content that we currently have.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1w7cvlz">Outro</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-kdgi68">And there you have it, that’s Blade, my new favorite damage carry. Something I didn’t mention in the gearing and substat part is that Blade solves a really common problem with gearing. How many times have you been farming a set and gotten a really good four line double crit roll but the main stat was HP%? Blade can turn items that would otherwise be bad into something good. Mostly, this is just for planar ornaments, since his relic set is pretty much unique to him, but even then, being able to turn something that would otherwise just be salvaged into an item that could be best in slot is really nice. I’d love to see more damage carries like this in the future, maybe a defense scaling damage carry so that it’s not a dead stat for most teams.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vs59bf">Thank you for watching. I’d love to hear about how Blade has been doing for you and how you’ve built him. Take care of yourself, and good luck on your rolls.</p> </div> <div data-svelte-h="svelte-2oalxl"><p>This is where character stats go (HP, DEF, SPD, etc)</p></div> </section>
