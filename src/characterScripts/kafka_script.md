# Intro

What's up, guys? Welcome to my full guide to Kafka. If you've ever done a Path of Nihility run in Simulated Universe and thought to yourself, "Wow, I wish I could do this in all the other content in the game," then this is the character for you. Damage over time has long been a pretty mid way of dealing damage since the game came out, and it's only been worse as more characters come out. This is especially true in Memory of Chaos where the idea is to take as many turns as you can before the enemy. Kafka tries to solve this issue by not only providing one of the strongest if not _the_ strongest DoT in the game but enabling the activation of DoT applied by the party during her turn. At first glance, her scaling doesn't seem particularly good outside of her DoT but when you start to play around with team comps she does a surprising amount of damage. There's a bit to cover, so let's get into it.

## What She does

Starting off, let's take a look at her kit. As far as her actual skills go, she isn't very complicated, but the way she plays requires a bit of setup in order to make the most out of her skills.

## Ultimate

The first thing that I want to look at is her Ultimate, Twilight Trill, because the DoT applied by this affects most of her other skills. At rank 10, it does a moderate amount of damage to all enemies and applies a shock equal to 290% of her attack. It has a 100% base chance to Shock all enemies hit and cause that shock to do 100% of it's damage immediately. When you unlock Kafka's first Major Trace, it changes to that instead of just causing the Shock to do damage, it affects all currently applied DoT.

This is what I was talking about when I said that there needs to be some setup. Unlike most other characters, you need to wait until the enemy is loaded up with your party's DoT to make the most out of this.

## Skill

Next, Kafka's skill, "Caressing Moonlight," is very similar to her Ultimate. She does pretty high damage to 1 target a small amount of damage to the two adjacent targets. She also causes all DoT applied to do 75% of their original damage. Ideally, you want to be using this every turn, but again like her Ultimate, you need to make sure that everyone in the party has already applied their DoT.

## Talent

Kafka's Talent, "Gentle but Cruel," is the second way she can apply shock. Whenever an ally uses a Basic Attack, she does a follow-up attack for moderate damage and has a 100% base chance to apply the same shock that her Ultimate does. Doing this has a one turn cool down which is indicated by the little dot on her party frame.

## Technique

Lastly, her Technique, "Mercy is Not Forgiveness," does a small amount of damage and applies the same Shock her Ultimate does.

## Ending Thoughts on Skills / Playstyle

Regardless of your party setup, the main goal here is to apply and maintain your shock and then detonate it with your Ultimate and Skill. In most cases, you're going to want to start the fight with her technique so that Shock is already applied, especially if Kafka is the fastest character in the party so that she can immediately detonate. If she isn't, a character needs to basic attack before her turn so that she can do a follow-up attack and apply her shock.

For your leveling priority, you're going to want to level her Ultimate up first so that the Shock she applies is stronger and the detonation is larger. Next, her skill, then her talent. Since you're never going to need to normal attack with her outside of very rare instances when you're out of points and character turns are out of order, you can ignore her basic attack until after you get all the major and minor traces.

## Traces

Speaking of which, let's go over her traces. As I said before, her first Major Trace makes her Ultimate deal all DoT instead of just her Shock. Her second Major Trace grants her 5 energy whenever a Shocked enemy dies, and her third Major Trace increases the base chance of her Ultimate, Talent, and Technique to apply Shock to 130% from 100%.

The third major trace is the highest priority. Getting the extra 30% base chance to apply shock almost completely removes her need to get any effect hit rate on her relics, especially after getting the minor traces that grant effect hit rate.

After you get that, then you can get her first Major Trace so that her Ultimate makes all DoT do damage instead of just her shock. And yeah, this is lower priority than the base chance. No matter what team you're playing, Kafka's DoT is going to be the strongest and it accounts for the majority of her damage. The higher level the enemy, the higher their debuff resistance is, and getting this first is going to make doing those higher difficulty fights way easier. The only instance that this may not be the case is if you're running a triple DoT team with her while leveling her up and she's mostly just there to detonate everyone else's DoT. If that's the case, then her first Major Trace takes priority.

Lastly, her Second Major Trace, can be put off for awhile. The extra energy is nice and because her Ultimate applies shock to all enemies, there's always going to be a shock on an enemy when it dies. The only problem is that it requires something to die, making it mostly useless during boss fights unless they have a lot of adds.

## How to Build

Now that we've gone over her kit, let's take a look at how to actually build Kafka.

### Relics and Planar Ornaments

For Relics, there's a few options you can use that are all pretty close to each other in terms of damage output assuming equal substats.

Kafka's best in slot is going to be 4p Band of Sizzling Thunder, followed by 2p Band and 2p Musketeer, then 2p Band and 2p Messenger.

If you're really into niche things, you can also try the Quantum set, "Genius of Brilliant Stars." DEF shred, or in this case ignoring DEF, is the number 1 way of boosting damage over time. It's so strong in fact, that if the enemy is weak to both Quantum and Lightning, the Quantum set can be one of her highest performing sets, beating the mixed 2p sets. That being said, this isn't something that I would ever recommend, it's mostly just here if you want to try it. Band of Sizzling Thunder is far more universal since the enemy only needs Lightning weakness.

### Stat priority

Now that we know what we're farming, let's see what we're looking for on these pieces. Because DoT doesn't crit and because she has such a high base chance to apply shock with her major trace, the stat requirement is actually really simple; You want to stack as much attack and speed as you can.

For the body piece, you're going to want attack %. For your boots, either speed or attack %, but generally you're going to want speed. For your planar sphere, you'll want lightning damage, and for your link rope you'll want attack %.

Substats are also pretty simple, following this priority:

1. EHR % ~28% (or more if you have E1)
2. ATK %
3. SPD
4. Flat ATK

Because of her Major Trace that increases the base chance of applying Shock, you're not going to need that much EHR % to guarantee it landing. The priority of ATK % and SPD can swap depending on how much you already have. It's usually recommended for to aim for 132 speed for Memory of Chaos, but I'd aim for around there even if you aren't doing MoC. In the higher difficulties for both Simulated Universe and Caverns of Corrosion, bosses start to get pretty fast so you're still going to need higher tiers of speed. If you have Kafka's signature light cone though, you don't need as much speed on your relics.

## Light Cones

Speaking of which, for your light cones, her signature light cone, "Patience is All You Need," is going to be her best. At SI1, it gives an unconditional 24% damage buff as well as a 4.8% speed buff that stacks up to 3 times after Kafka attacks. This includes her follow-up attack from her talent. It also causes her attacks to apply, "Erode," which counts as a Shock and deals 60% of her attack at the start of the turn for 1 turn. Because this is a DoT, both her Ultimate and Skill trigger it.

"Good Night and Sleep Well" is her second best light cone. For every debuff on the enemy, Kafka gains 12% damage stacking up to 3 times at SI1. At SI5, it's a 24% damage buff. This buff applies to DoT as well.

And if you haven't gotten "Good Night" and aren't pulling for her signature light cone, then "Fermata" is what you want to use. It's super easy to get to SI 5 between weekly bosses and Hall of Memories and if you can get it to SI5, it gives her 32% break effect and 32% damage to enemies with Shock or Windshear, which also applies to their DoT.

You can also use Welt's light cone, "In The Name of the World, " which gives 24% damage to debuffed enemies. When Kafka uses her skill, she also gains 18% effect hit rate and 24% attack. Because of the high base stats, this ends up being ever so slightly better than a maxed out "Fermata," but the difference is so small that I wouldn't bother using resources on it if you're only going to use it on Kafka.

### Team Comps

Next, I want to go over what teams you're going to be using. While Kafka _can_ be run as the only damage character, Kafka really starts to outperform other damage characters when she's partnered up with at least 1 other DoT character.

For a 4 star team, you're going to want to use Natasha, Sampo, and then either a support like Asta, Tingyun, or Pela, or another Dot character like Luka.

For a more premium team, Sampo is still required, but we'll be replacing Natasha with Luocha and Pela with Silverwolf.

Whether another support or a third DoT character is better really depends on what you've invested in or willing to invest in. Because both her skill and her Ultimate trigger the DoT applied by all characters, having more DoT sources _should_ be better. But if the character that's applying them hasn't been invested in and their DoT doesn't do much, then they aren't going to contribute as much as a support that's either buffing Kafka's damage directly like Tingyun or shredding defense like Pela and Silverwolf. Sampo is the only DoT party member that can get away with less investment because his Ultimate applies a 30% increased DoT debuff, but even then you still need to invest pretty heavily in him.

This is Kafka's biggest problem. Because her damage relies so heavily on the DoT applied by her team, the investment to get her damage to where it needs to be is really high and something I would think about before pulling for her. If you're a free to play player that doesn't have at least a good Sampo (and I wouldn't hold it against you if that was true), her damage isn't going to be very impressive. This isn't meant to discourage you from pulling for her, because at the end of the day, whether or not you like the character is more important than the damage. But it's important to understand that she relies very heavily on her team to perform well.

### Can I Use Serval?

Before moving on, I wanted to bring up Serval because she also does DoT but it's Shock. You can still use her if you have her built. Shock from different sources stack so you can still have both Kafka's Shock and Serval's Shock on the same enemy and they aren't going to interfere with each other. If she's the only DoT character that you have built, she makes a pretty good option as a second DoT character or in place of Sampo while you level him up. If you're using Silver Wolf though this is going to be a _really_ point hungry team and is going to need some point management.

## Eidolons

The last thing I want to go over are her Eidolons and how much impact they have on her gameplay. As with most characters, Kafka is perfectly good at E0 and I would only pull for copies if you love how she plays and want to make her better. There's nothing in her Eidolons that I think is worth spending money on, but if you _are_ going to pull for Eidolons, you aren't going to be disappointed.

Kafka's E1 gives her follow-up attack a 100% base chance to apply a debuff that increases damage over time by 30% for 2 turns. Because this impacts all DoT, this is a massive buff to your entire party and is going to make a triple DoT team a lot more viable. But, something to keep in mind if you do pull for this, is that it's only a 100% _base_ chance. This doesn't mean it's guaranteed and you're going to need to hit closer to 67% effect hit rate if you decide to go for this. If you do, try to get that extra effect hit rate on your substats before getting an effect hit rate body piece.

Her E2 gives her entire party a 25% damage over time buff as long as she's on the field. Like her E1, this makes having a triple DoT comp far more competitive.

Like everyone else, her E3 gives +2 to her skill and +1 to her basic attack.

Her E4 makes it so that when an enemy takes damage from specifically her Shock, she regenerates 2 Energy. Out of all of her Eidolons, this is the least interesting, but if you're doing content with a lot of easy to kill enemies, this paired with her Major Trace that gives energy on kill, this is going to boost her AOE significantly by letting her spam her Ultimate far more frequently.

Her E5 gives +2 to her Ultimate and Talent.

And finally her E6 makes it so the shock that's applied by her Ultimate, Talent, and Technique has a damage multiplier increase of 156% and it lasts an extra turn.

All of these are really strong. If you are going to be pulling though, I would stop at E1 or E2. E1 is the biggest team power spike and E2 is the second highest. E6 is strong for her personal damage but unless she's the only damage over time character on the team, it's not going to contribute as much as the first two Eidolons do.

## Outro

And with that, thank you for watching. Kafka is a pretty niche character and one that outside of Simulated Universe, I'm not sure how much I'll play. It's not that I think she's bad, but she needs some setup to be good and least in the first few days of playing her, I wasn't that impressed. But I think that's more a problem with the options of support and DoT characters that we currently have. When you have her setup correctly and especially when fighting more than 1 enemy, her damage is actually pretty crazy, even with just random pieces of gear that I had. When we finally get another 5 star DoT character or a better DoT 4 star, I'd really like to revisit her and see how she pairs with them, because all it really takes for her damage to get completely out of hand is 1 more really strong DoT character.

If you've made it this far, thank you very much. If there was something I got wrong or you don't agree with, lemme know in the comments. I'd also really like to hear how your experience with Kafka has been so far, especially in Memory of Chaos if you do it. I'm not a MoC gamer usually but she seemed to steamroll a lot of those enemies.

I'll see you all later. In the mean time, may your 5 stars be early and your relics be double crit.
