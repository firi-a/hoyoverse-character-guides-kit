# Intro

Inbibitor Lunae Dan Heng is the latest Destruction character that has the biggest mouthful of a name I've seen in a character for a long time. IL Dan Heng is an Imaginary damage character that we got a taste of during the last patch's main story. I'm going to try and avoid comparing him to Blade too much, but I'm warning you now, there's going to be some of it because they fill very similar rolls and are going to compete with each other for teammates. The biggest difference between them besides their element is where Blade is primarily focused on dealing AoE damage, IL Dan Heng focuses on single target with some extra cleave. Where they're most similar though is that they both are Basic Attack oriented characters with a skill that buffs that basic attack.

## What They Do

Before jumping into each skill, I want to preface that any numbers you see are at rank 10. So, with that being said, let's see what he actually does.

## Skill

IL Dan Heng's skill, "Dracore Libre," doesn't consume points when cast but instead puts him in a buffing state where you can consume up to 3 skill points to Enhance his next Basic Attack.

Consuming one skill point turns his basic attack into, "Transcendence," a three-hit, single target attack. Consuming two skill points turns his basic attack into, "Divine Spear," a 5 hit, single target attack, that also hits the two adjacent targets, and consuming three skill points turns his basic attack into, "Fulgurant Leap," a 7 hit, single target attack, that also hits the two adjacent targets.

In addition to that, when you either use, "Divine Spear," or "Fulgurant Leap," IL Dan Heng gains a stack of, "Dominating Roar," from the 4th hit onward. So in Divine Spear's case you gain two stacks and Fulgurant Leap gives four stacks.

This has a max of 4 stacks and increases his Crit Damage by 12% per stack, totaling 48%.

This skill does a lot so the easiest way to think of it is more points spent = more damage.

Because his skill augments his basic attack, IL Dan Heng cannot generate points, just like the other characters we have that augment their basic attacks. Unlike them though, IL Dan Heng is also _using_ far more than they are each turn, because you want to be using the strongest basic attack that you can afford. Skill point management with IL Dan Heng is _extremely_ important and trying to plan ahead for your other party members buffs and debuffs.

But, there is one way we can mitigate how many skill points that we consume without losing damage.

## Ultimate

IL Dan Heng's Ultimate, "Azure's Aqua Ablutes All," try saying that 5 times fast, does a very high amount of damage to a single target and high damage to two adjacent targets. It also grants two stacks of, "Squama Sacrosancta," which he can hold up to 3 of that act as skill points. This means that after every Ultimate, your next, "Fulgurant Leap," is only going to cost 1 real skill point, and the one after that is only going to cost 2, before going back to its original cost.

## Talent

Lastly, IL Dan Heng's Talent, "Righteous Heart," grants 1 stack of Righteous Heart after every hit unleashed during attack. Each stack gives him 10% damage and you can have up to 6 stacks that last until the end of his turn. Fulgurant Leap is already an extremely hard hitting skill and with this, the last hit from it does an extra 60% damage, with each hit leading up to that doing more and more damage.

## Skill Leveling Priority

## Traces

Moving onto his traces, understandably, seeing as how all of his skills either increase his damage or his crit damage, his traces are a little unimpactful.

His first major trace gives him 15 energy at the start of a battle, his second major trace gives him a 35% chance to resist crowd control which you don't see often on a damage carry, and his last major trace gives him 12% Crit Rate against enemies that are weak to Imaginary.

The first two can be delayed until after you get the last one, since that's the one that's going to impact your damage the most. After you get the third major trace, pick up the crowd control resist one, and then lastly the energy major trace.

## Relics and Planar Ornaments

Now that we know what he does, let's take a look at what sets you want to be using on him.

IL Dan Heng's best in slot is going to be 4p, "Wastelander of Banditry Desert," followed by 2p Wastelander and 2p Musketeer, then 4p Musketeer.

Very standard way of gearing and even though IL Dan Heng doesn't debuff enemies himself, there's going to be pretty consistent debuffs from the rest of our team that you should be able to maintain the 4p bonus of Wastelander all the time.

For your Planar Ornaments, "Rutilant Arena" is his best in slot followed by, "Space Sealing Station." With how hard his normal attacks are already hitting, the extra 20% boost to Normal Attack damage from Rutilant basically going to be making his Fulgurant Leap equal to an Ultimate every hit.

## Stat Priority

Now, let's see what stats we want to find on those pieces.

For your main pieces, you're going to want Crit Rate or Crit Damage on your chest, depending on which you need the most, SPD or ATK on your boots, Imaginary Damage on your sphere, and ATK % on your Link Rope.

For substats, IL Dan Heng follows the standard Crit Rate or Crit Damage, SPD, ATK% priority.

Because Rutilant Arena has such a high Crit Rate requirement and IL Dan Heng already gets a good amount of Crit Damage, I would lean towards getting a Crit Rate body piece over a Crit Damage one. I would aim for 70% crit without any buffs to guarantee that you benefit from Rutilant Arena's set effect at all times.

Whether or not you want SPD on your boots partly depends on your team comp, which I'll go over in a bit, and how much speed you have through sub stats. Generally, whether you're doing Memory of Chaos or not, you're going to want to aim for 132 or more speed, as long as your supports are faster. 120 speed is the minimum you want to be at high levels.

For your Link Rope, I could also see a scenario where you might want Energy Regen. Because his Ultimate gives makes his skill point management far easier, having the increased Ultimate use could let you use more Fulgurant Leaps within a fight, increasing overall damage and letting you use a more point hungry team. This is entirely speculation though, but something that I want to try out and see how well it works.

## Light Cones

Moving onto his Light Cones, it's to no one's surprise that his signature light cone, "Brighter Than the Sun," is his best in slot.

"Brighter Than the Sun," grants 18% Crit Rate. When the wearer uses a Basic Attack, they gain 1 stack of Dragon's Call which gives 18% ATK and 6% Energy regen. This buff stacks twice and is permanent.

"Unreachable Side," is his second best light cone. It also gives 18% crit and gives 18% max HP. Whenever the wearer is attacked, they also gain a 24% damage buff that's removed after they use an attack.

"Something Irreplaceable," is the third best light cone, giving him 24% ATK and giving him 24% damage if he kills an enemy or gets attacked.

If you don't have any of these, then, "A Secret Vow," or "On the Fall of an Aeon," will serve him pretty well.

Nothing in IL Dan Heng's kit actually makes him want to be attacked, making most of the other Destruction Light Cones less valuable and less consistent than something like his signature light cone that doesn't have a damage or kill condition. But, next banner we're going to be getting Lynx, who has the ability to increase the taunt value of a Destruction Path character if they're the target of her skill. It also increases their HP, making them a more suitable tank. This also means that both Blade and Clara's signature light cones are buffed in the sense that IL Dan Heng can more reliably activate their buff. His signature light is still, by far, the best but if you're a free to play player or a very light spender, have either Blade or Clara's light cone, and are pulling for Lynx, I would keep that in mind when deciding whether or not you want to pull for his light cone.

## Team Comps

Next, let's take a look at the teams you want to be using for him. Because IL Dan Heng doesn't have any quirks other than his very high skill point usage, his teams end up being pretty flexible and really depend on how much point management you want to do.

For a 4 star team, I recommend going with:

1. IL DH
2. Natasha (until Lynx)
3. Pela
4. Tingyun

Both Pela and Tingyun are super point efficient characters that are going to help a lot with management.

## Eidolons

Now, finally, this brings us to his Eidolons. Like most characters, IL Dan Heng is perfectly good at E0 and is going to take you through all the content this game has to offer now and in the future. I would never recommend spending money to pull for copies, especially if you can't comfortable afford it.

IL Dan Heng's E1 increases the max Righteous Heart stacks by 4 and grants 1 additional stack per hit. As a refresher, this is from his Talent where each hit from his attacks grants a stacking 10% buff per hit. E1 makes the max damage increase 100% and you gain them two at a time, buffing not just the overall damage but how quickly it ramps up as well.

E2 advances him 100% after using his Ultimate and it causes his Ultimate to give 3 stacks of Squama instead of 2. This changes up his playstyle a bit and you're going to have to be a little careful with turn order with this one because it can start to throw off buffs or debuffs.

As usual, E3 and E5 grant +2 to his Skill, Talent, and Ultimate, and +1 to his Basic Attack.

His E4 makes Dominating Roar last 1 more turn.

And lastly E6 makes it so that when an _ally_ uses their Ultimate, the next "Fulgurant Leap" gains 20% Imaginary penetration stacking up to 3 times.

If you're going to be pulling for copies, I would stay at E2 unless you plan to go for E6.

If you are, though, this is going to change how he plays a bit. Turn Advancement is strong, but it can also greatly throw off buffs and character rotations. This is getting into the optimization side of things that, realistically, aren't going to impact runs _too_ much, but it's something to keep in mind if you're trying to get the most out of him.

E6 also changes how you play somewhat. Depending on how much Penetration actually affects damage, it's pretty likely that delaying using Fulgurant Leap until after at least a couple party members have used their Ultimates is probably going to end up in more damage. Again, this is getting into the optimization side of things, and something that I would need more time to test to see if that's actually true.
