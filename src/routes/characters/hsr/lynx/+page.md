# Character Script Outline

## Intro

While everyone is losing their mind over Fu Xuan, I have been waiting for Lynx the second they announced her kit. The fact that we now have a healer that increases the taunt value of Destruction and Preservation characters is insane. For those that didn't want my Blade video, Blade is by far my favorite damage carry. He fits into just about every piece of content, but he has a similar problem to Clara in that in order to get the most out of his kit, he needs to be attacked. And unlike Clara who just use March, he needs to actually lose health from that attack to benefit from it. Lynx is March for Blade. Which isn't to say she's niche, even on teams without Blade, she's an amazing healer that in most situations beats Natasha and is going to rival with Bailu. So with that said, let's take a look at what she actually does.

## What They Do

Lynx has one unique aspect about her and that's the buff, "Survival Response." This buff increases max HP and with Eidolons, further buffs the characters damage and tankiness. Keep in mind that all skills that I talk about are assumed to be rank 10.

## Skill

Lynx's skill, "Salted Camping Cans," is the biggest part of her kit. It heals 1 target for 12% of her max HP + 320 and applies the buff, "Survival Response." Survival Response increases the target's HP by 7.% of Lynx's max HP + 200 for 2 turns. If the character is either Destruction or Preservation, they also greatly increase the chance of that target being hit. As far as we know, this is the same kind of buff that March 7th applies with her skill, so it's not that it guarantees the targets are going to hit the Preservation or Destruction character, but the likelihood of that happening is noticeably higher.

## Ultimate

Lynx's Ultimate, "Snowfield First Aid," dispels a debuff from the targeted ally and heals them for 13.% of her max HP +360. Yes, her Ultimate is a single target heal instead of a party-wide heal.

## Talent

Her Talent, "Outdoor Survival Experience," applies a heal over time for 3.6% of Lynx's HP + 96 and if they are affected by "Survival Response," they additionally are healed for 4.5% of her max HP + 120.

## Traces

The first Major Trace grants her 2 energy whenever an ally with "Survival Response" is hit.
Her Second Major Trace gives her a 35% chance to resist crowd control effects
And her third major trace extends the heal over time from her talent by 1 turn.

## Skill Wrap-Up

The important thing to remember when using Lynx in your party is that there is no, "Oh shit" button that you can press in the same way that you can with Natasha or Bailu. Instead, you're relying entirely on the taunt buff that, "Survival Response," gives to do focus all of the damage on a character that can take it and preventing area damage from being dealt in the first place. That being said, if you're doing content where there is a lot of area damage from the boss that aren't targeted, like Cocolia, then Lynx is both going to struggle and eat up a lot of skill points that could be used for damage. This is the only content that I wouldn't recommend putting her in. Everything else, she's going to do fine, but the lack of party-wide healing is going to make her struggle in certain fights.

## Skill Priority

## Eidolons

Now to wrap up skills, let's take a look at her Eidolons. Like most characters in the game, she's perfectly fine at E0 and doesn't actually need any Eidolons to do what she does. That being said, she's also a 4 star, so getting her to E6, especially if you're pulling for Fu Xuan, is a little more likely than getting Eidolons on a 5 star. A lot of people say that 4 stars are only good if they're E6 and I don't really agree with that, at least in Lynx's case.

Her E1 increases her outgoing healing on characters that are equal to or under 50% HP by 20%, which also affects the healing over time she applies.

Her E2 gives any target with Survival Response the chance to resist a debuff one time.

Her E3 and E5 give +2 to her skill, ultimate, and talent, and +1 to her basic attack.

Her E4 makes it so that when a character gains, "Survival Response," they also gain an attack buff equal to 3% of her max HP for 1 turn.

And lastly her E6 Further increases the HP% buff you get from Survival Response by 6% of her max HP. Survival Response also now gives the target a 30% Effect Res buff.

Her Eidolons are really good and instead of being the thing that makes her a strong 4 star, they take the core mechanic she has and makes it even stronger. Every Eidolon, including the increase to talent levels. If Fu Xuan is a character that you're trying to get, I wish you luck on pulling so that you get copies of Lynx because she's worth getting copies for.

## Relics and Planar Ornaments

Now, let's take a look at how to actually build her.

For relics, her best in slot is going to be, "Messenger Traversing Hackerspace," followed by 2p Messenger and 2p Longevous Disciple, then 2p Messenger and 2p Passerby of Wandering Clouds.

For your Planar Ornaments, you're going to want to get either, "Broken Keel," or "Fleet of the Ageless."

## Stat Priority

For stats, you're going to want HP % on the body piece, speed on the boots, HP % on the planar sphere, and Energy Regeneration % on the link rope. You can also run HP % on the link rope, but being able to use her Ultimate more often is going to be better than the increased healing and health increase that you're going to get from the HP %.

## Light Cones

Next up, her light cones. Lynx's best in slot is going to be, "Time Waits for No One," followed by, "Post-Op Conversation," then, "Warmth Shortens Cold Nights," and, "Multiplication.

"Time Waits for No One," is probably the best light cone you can get for Abundance characters in general. It increases both outgoing healing by 12% and max HP by 18% to further boost outgoing healing. It also provides a small but not insignificant damage buff by making enemies take an additional 36% damage whenever an ally attacks based on the amount of healing recorded.

"Post-Op Conversation," gives a pretty noticeable amount of energy which is always strong.

"Warmth Shortens Cold Nights," can _really_ help her sustain the party longer. The heal is pretty small, only being 2% of her max HP, but considering Lynx doesn't have any party-wide healing, this is pretty handy. In some cases, you might actually want to use this over, "Post-Op," if you have it and are planning to do content that needs the party healing.

Finally, "Multiplication," is a little odd where whenever Lynx basic attacks her action is advanced by 12% when it's at SI5. Considering she's going to be doing that a lot, this helps a bit with skill point management by getting off more basic attacks per fight than you normally would. The downside, and why it's not ranked higher, is that the low base stats and no increased healing or HP means that Lynx's healing is going to be on the low end. At high difficulties, that's going to be a problem. I would only ever recommend using this if you know what you're doing and you know the content is right for it. Otherwise, I would stick to something else.

## Team Comps

Because Lynx is a healer, she generally can fit into any team you're currently using. Normally when I do these I split the teams into a 4 star and a premium team but because Lynx can fit into just about anywhere, I'd rather highlight characters that she synergizes with the most.

Unsurprisingly, Blade is at the top of the list. Increasing his Max HP and also making him more likely to be hit is huge for his damage. For the same reason, Clara is going to be another good teammate for her instead of March. March, right now, only really is useful for Clara teams and Lynx is going to be better at it.

The only specific team that I want to bring up is with this banner, we can now do a Mono Quantum team built with Lynx, Fu Xuan, Seele, and Silver Wolf. Because of Silver Wolf only being allowed to apply Quantum Weakness, this is most likely going to be the best team that you can for Seele. While Lynx doesn't directly benefit any specific character in this team the same way that she does Blade and Clara, she's the only Quantum abundance character so it's kinda necessary for mono quantum.

## Outro

And that's going to be it for Lynx. Honestly, there's not a whole lot to say about her; She's a really strong 4 star healer that enables Mono Quantum and fills a really important roll for Blade and Clara that no one else can provide. If you aren't using either of those and you already have Bailu or Luocha leveled, yeah you can probably skip leveling her or pulling for her in the first place. If you are using one of those and you don't need the outrageous healing that Luocha has, I would use her over Luocha, I'm not gonna lie. Especially for Blade since his heal activates from his follow-up attack so she's not even going to need to heal him that often. Let me know what you guys think of her. This isn't some shiny new 5 star or anyone that does something crazy so I'd love to know how you're feeling about her or if you're even planning on building her.

Thanks for watching, and good luck on your pulls.
