Mostly, this is just for planar ornaments, since his relic set is pretty much unique to him, but even then, being able to turn something that would otherwise just be salvaged into an item that could be best in slot is really nice.

Welcome to my full guide to Kafka. If you’ve ever done a Path of Nihility run in Simulated Universe and thought to yourself, “Wow, I wish I could do this in all the other content in the game,” then this is the character for you. Damage over time has long been a pretty mid way of dealing damage since the game came out, and it’s only been worse as more characters come out. This is especially true in Memory of Chaos where the idea is to take as many turns as you can before the enemy. Kafka tries to solve this issue by not only providing one of the strongest if not <em>the</em> strongest DoT in the game but enabling the activation of DoT applied by the party during her turn. At first glance, her scaling doesn’t seem particularly good outside of her DoT but when you start to play around with team comps she does a surprising amount of damage. There’s a bit to cover, so let’s get into it.",k,C,c="What She does",w,b,ke="Starting off, let’s take a look at her kit.

At rank 10, it does a moderate amount of damage to all enemies and applies a shock equal to 290% of her attack. It has a 100% base chance to Shock all enemies hit and cause that shock to do 100% of it’s damage immediately. When you unlock Kafka’s first Major Trace, it changes to that instead of just causing the Shock to do damage, it affects all currently applied DoT.",Pt,H,He="This is what I was talking about when I said that there needs to be some setup. Unlike most other characters, you need to wait until the enemy is loaded up with your party’s DoT to make the most out of this.",Ht,T,Te="Skill",Tt,I,Ie="Next, Kafka’s skill, “Caressing Moonlight,” is very similar to her Ultimate. She does pretty high damage to 1 target a small amount of damage to the two adjacent targets. She also causes all DoT applied to do 75% of their original damage. Ideally, you want to be using this every turn, but again like her Ultimate, you need to make sure that everyone in the party has already applied their DoT.",It,S,Se="Talent",St,L,Le="Kafka’s Talent, “Gentle but Cruel,” is the second way she can apply shock.

In most cases, you’re going to want to start the fight with her technique so that Shock is already applied, especially if Kafka is the fastest character in the party so that she can immediately detonate. If she isn’t, a character needs to basic attack before her turn so that she can do a follow-up attack and apply her shock.",jt,M,Me="For your leveling priority, you’re going to want to level her Ultimate up first so that the Shock she applies is stronger and the detonation is larger.

As I said before, her first Major Trace makes her Ultimate deal all DoT instead of just her Shock.

And yeah, this is lower priority than the base chance. No matter what team you’re playing, Kafka’s DoT is going to be the strongest and it accounts for the majority of her damage. The higher level the enemy, the higher their debuff resistance is, and getting this first is going to make doing those higher difficulty fights way easier. The only instance that this may not be the case is if you’re running a triple DoT team with her while leveling her up and she’s mostly just there to detonate everyone else’s DoT. If that’s the case, then her first Major Trace takes priority.",$t,F,Fe="Lastly, her Second Major Trace, can be put off for awhile.
